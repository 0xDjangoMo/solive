# Introduction
SoLive is a lightweight and fleaxible online Solidity playground, inspired by remix-IDE and react-live. SoLive enables you to edit, compile, deploy, and interact with Solidity smart contracts within a React component. You can integrate SoLive into your website or tutorial, allowing users to execute Solidity code directly in their browsers. Moreover, SoLive is compatible with mobile browsers.

## Use cases:
1. Education: In the [WTF Solidity](https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity) tutorials, we will utilize SoLive to replace conventional code blocks, enabling students to read and run the code concurrently.
2. Developer Onboarding: Layer2 projects can leverage SoLive to attract and recruit Ethereum developers.

## How it works
SoLive is lightweight and flexible by design. It includes only the essential modules needed for editing, compiling, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts.
1. Edit Module: We employ the Monaco Editor as the code editor.
2. Compile Module: We utilize `solcjs` to compile smart contracts based on the chosen Solidity version.
3. Deploy Module: We deploy the compiled contracts to the local EVM using a combination of `ethersjs V5` and `ethereumjs vm`.
4. Interact Module: To interact with the deployed contracts, we use `ethersjs V5` and a custom ABI-UI converter.
